# CGA Mid Examination Project

### This project is made using Unity with C# Programming Language to fulfill our Mid Term Examination of Mobile Cross-Platform Programming.

#### Features
Minimum features of this exam is as follow
<ol>
  <li><b>Stage</b>
      <ol>
        <li>There is a stage with eight spotlight (four at the top and four at the bottom) which light the stage at 45 degrees angle.</li>
        <li>In the middle of the stage, there is a point light.</li>
        <li>The stage and its backdrop must be given texture.</li>
        <li>There is a procedural-made standing mic at the middle of the stage.</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>Spectator Chairs</b>
      <ol>
        <li>There are some spectator chair arranged. There are 3 (three) rows of chair with each row have 4 (four) chairs.</li>
        <li>The chair must be given texture.</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>Desk(s) with 4 legs</b>
      <ol>
         <li>There is/are desk with 4 (four) desk legs with a monitor and procedural-made mouse.</li>
         <li>Give texture to the desk and monitor.</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>Sunlight</b>: Simulate the sunlight rotation to show morning, noon, afternoon, and night scene in the background.</li>
  <li><b>User's input from keyboard and mouse</b>
      <ol>
         <li>Allow user to move the third-person camera with keyboard input (W: to front, S: to back, A: to left, and D: to right).</li>
         <li>Allow user to do rotation to the camera with mouse input.</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>Use the lighting and place the object realistically.</b></li>
</ol>

Additional features from our group is as follow
<ol>
  <li>Make the spotlight tube GameObject and synchronize the movement of GameObject with spotlight movement.</li>
  <li>Make the mouse GameObject shape realistically.</li>
  <li>Give the mouse GameObject real texture.</li>
  <li>Detailed and realistic monitor legs.</li>
  <li>Roof for the stage to hang the top spotlight.</li>
  <li>Unique, neat, orderly, and realistic layout of GameObject.</li>
  <li>Terrain for the scene and texture for terrain.</li>
  <li>Realistic standing mic's shape and texture.</li>
  <li>Detailed wooden table's texture.</li>
  <li>Armrest for chair.</li>
  <li>Stage's stairs.</li>
  <li>Stage's rigging.</li>
  <li>Realistic stage backdrop's texture.</li>
  <li>Unique movement of spotlight.</li>
  <li>Self-made input.
    <ol>
      <li>Arrow keys on keyboard: Have the same effect of WASD (up == W; down == S; left == A; and right == D).</li>
      <li>- and = keys (- and + keys): slow down (- keys) and quicken (+ keys) rotation of directional light (sunlight) such that the simulation of morning, noon, afternoon, and night will be slower/faster.</li>
      <li>, and . keys (< and > keys): slow down (< keys) and quicken (> keys) rotation of stage top and bottom stage spotlight.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Keyboard for set of computer in the desk with detailed shape and texture.</li>
  <li>Detailed texture even for the bottom side of GameObject.</li>
  <li>Detailed texture for LCD monitor.</li>
  <li>Some GameObjects texture can absorb the light from directional, point, or spotlight.</li>
</ol>
